                    In the past five years, speech recognition (SR) technology has transformed Computer-Assisted Language Learning (CALL) by enabling real-time feedback, interactive dialogues, and greater accessibility, especially for low-resource languages. This blog explores its key advancements, applications, and challenges in language education.

                <h2>1. Breaking Barriers in Pronunciation and Feedback</h2>
                <p>
                    Early SR systems often struggled with accuracy, especially for non-native speakers or languages with complex phonetic structures. However, deep learning models, such as transformer-based ASR architectures, have significantly improved precision in speech-to-text conversion.
                </p>
                <p>
                    These enhanced ASR models provide immediate feedback on pronunciation errors, allowing learners to adjust intonation or stress in real time—a crucial feature for mastering tonal languages like Mandarin or Vietnamese. For instance, a study evaluating Wav2Vec2.0 and Whisper AI demonstrated their effectiveness in delivering phoneme-level pronunciation analysis for non-native children learning Dutch (<a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/346542775" target="_blank">ResearchGate, 2024</a>).

                <h2>2. Supporting Multilingualism and Low-Resource Languages</h2>
                <p>
                    One of the most significant applications of SR technology has been its role in linguistically marginalized communities. Traditional speech recognition systems relied on extensive labeled datasets, which are often unavailable for low-resource languages.

                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p>
                    Speech recognition has revolutionized Computer-Assisted Language Learning (CALL), from real-time feedback to language preservation. As the technology evolves, prioritizing linguistic diversity is essential to bridging educational gaps rather than widening them.
