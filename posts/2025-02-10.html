                <p>
                    Over the past five years, speech synthesis technology has revolutionized Computer-Assisted Language Learning (CALL), enabling learners to engage with languages in ways that were once unimaginable. From personalized pronunciation coaching to immersive conversational practice, advancements in text-to-speech (TTS) systems have made language acquisition more accessible, inclusive, and effective.

                <h2>1. Breaking Barriers with Natural and Expressive Speech</h2>
                <p>
                    Early TTS systems often produced robotic, monotonous audio, limiting their utility in language education. However, the integration of <strong>deep learning models</strong> has led to synthetic voices that rival human speech in naturalness and expressivity.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For instance, a <a href="https://asmp-eurasipjournals.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s13636-024-00329-7" target="_blank">systematic review of expressive speech synthesis</a> highlights how modern systems now control prosody, emotion, and speaking styles, allowing learners to hear nuanced variations in tone, stress, and intonation. This is critical for mastering languages like Mandarin, where tonal accuracy is essential, or languages with complex prosodic structures, such as Japanese.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Applications like AI-driven audiobooks and interactive chatbots leverage these advancements to simulate real-world conversations. For example, learners can practice negotiating in French with a virtual assistant that responds empathetically, adjusting its speech style based on context—a leap made possible by models trained on multilingual datasets.
                </p>

                <h2>2. Supporting Language Diversity and Inclusivity</h2>
                <p>
                    A major focus in recent years has been ensuring that speech synthesis serves <strong>linguistically marginalized communities</strong>. Recent advancements indicate that TTS systems are playing an increasingly significant role in supporting Indigenous and low-resource languages.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This issue is expected to be a key focus at the <a href="https://call-research.org/conferences/call2025/" target="_blank">upcoming 2025 International CALL Research Conference</a>, where discussions will center on leveraging CALL technologies for language preservation and accessibility.
